# 14/11/18 Semester Project Meeting (3)

## What we did before the meeting:
- Got a correct version of the ridge regression (without encryption) and verified the result β.
- Checked the ridge regression on 3 different datasets. The datasets can be found on UCI (Forestfires, Concrete, Machine). On our project, the datasets can be loaded by executing the program 'getDatasets.sh' in the 'Datasets' folder.
- Split the code into classes representing different parties: Users, Evaluator and CSP.
- Implemented the second protocol from the paper with paillier up to the point where we need to use the garble circuits.


## What we need to do for next time:
- Check how to compute the error for a linear regression.
- Check paillier security parameters to encrypt data (maybe we can change the parameters to make the encryption faster).
- Try to add μA and μb to A and b without encrypting them before.
- Find an adapted framework to implement the yao garble circuits (check fastgc, tinygarble, gabes, Tasty, ABY...).
- Implement either yao millionnaire or a small boolean circuit.
- Work with small databases with integer values.
